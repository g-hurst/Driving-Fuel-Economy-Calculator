# Driving-Fuel-Economy-Calculator

This program calculates fuel economy of the user in both metric and us customary. The user starts by entering their name, and then they are able to select 
if they would like to input their distance driven and amount of gas used in either metric or us customary units. After the program runs, both us customary 
and metric units for economy are calculated and displayed. This program uses data validation in order to guarantee that the user enters the proper data in 
order for the code to run as expected and is looped in order to run as many calculations as desired.
